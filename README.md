A BAC calculator for the geeks.

Installation
========================
## Installation
The following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x therefore you likely already have it.

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkingsman/BetterBac.git
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

BetterBAC will now be listening for HTTP requests on port 4001. Raw files are in the `dist` folder.

* Integrate Gulp; localize dependencies
